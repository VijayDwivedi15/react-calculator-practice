# 3R (React, Redux, Ramda) Calculator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/panayi/calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/panayi/calculator) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/panayi/calculator/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/panayi/calculator)

## Features
- Point-free functional programming with [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/).
- Math expression evaluation based on [Math.js](http://mathjs.org/).
- Uses [Redux](redux.js.org) for validating pressed keys and calculating expressions while typing. Default keys for basic arithmetic calculations, but easy to customize the allowed keys (see [initialState.js](https://github.com/panayi/calculator/blob/master/src/initialState.js)).
- Theme switching based on Redux, a custom `<ThemeManager>` component and [Radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium).
- Based on [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit).
